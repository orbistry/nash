# nash-codegen

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-14

### Minor changes

- [ca0a5ee](https://github.com/orbistry/nash/commit/ca0a5eef111e56dfd14168bede4a785d6cd3b01f) Compile reachable solved definitions with static trait specialization, scoped field-access sharing, checked program assembly, and bounded comptime evaluation. Add exhaustive Core traversal helpers, single-wrapped CBOR encoding, and executable Vesting budget baselines. — Thanks @MicroProofs!
- [9440314](https://github.com/orbistry/nash/commit/9440314fdd5ff4433cb374128fb2610f52d77303) Add Core IR with explicit representations, UPLC text printing and checked DeBruijn conversion, executable structural lowering, recursion rewriting, complete builtin mapping, and lazy canonical type conversion for code generation. Add checked Data casts, shared pattern decision trees, evidence normalization, layout-demand analysis, and a driver callback retaining solved build state. — Thanks @MicroProofs!

### Patch changes

- [3cb7a0f](https://github.com/orbistry/nash/commit/3cb7a0f1ec352bf13522e1eb71f0100ff873d3df) Preserve miette diagnostic codes and error/warning markers in terminal output. Show source paths relative to the project root while keeping file hyperlinks absolute.
  
  Expand colorless rendered diagnostic snapshot coverage across parser, canonicalizer, solver, driver, and CLI tests. Record Nash source instead of Rust assertion expressions in source-driven snapshots, move codegen snapshots to source-compilation tests, and check snapshot metadata for regressions. Keep direct assertions for internal error values and hand-built Core behavior. — Thanks @MicroProofs!
